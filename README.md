# 📩 Spam SMS Detection Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building an **SMS classification model** to detect **spam messages** effectively. The model utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and various machine learning algorithms to **classify messages as spam or ham (non-spam).**  

## 🎯 Task Objectives  
- Develop a robust **spam detection system** using machine learning.  
- Perform **text preprocessing** (lemmatization, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization).  
- Handle **class imbalance** using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).  
- Train multiple **ML models** (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).  
- Evaluate models based on **accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix**.  
- Save trained models and the vectorizer for **future use**.
